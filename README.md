# yachtworld-puppeteer

Scrapes selected makes and produces csv or json of price, year, length, model and url.

Modify the url template to widen or narrow your search space. Right now it's for sailing yachts 40-60ft, 1990-2010, prices in AUD.

Took me about 6 minutes to scrape all 16 brands I've selected (~2600 listings). Have a look at `results` folder for example (generated at February 2020).

Usage:

```
npm i
node .
```
